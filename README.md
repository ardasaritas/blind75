# 🧠 Blind 75 LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains mostly documented solutions I've studided (not all are particularly mine) for the [Blind 75](neetcode.io) — a curated set of coding problems considered essential for software engineering interviews.
My current workflow is to work on the algorithm for 1-2 hours max. Then look up hints, and then solutions. 
I also try to examine all possible solutions for most questions even if I solved it one way. 

## 🚀 Purpose

I’m solving these problems to:
- Sharpen my algorithmic thinking.
- Build a clean reference for common patterns, and be able to recognize them at some point. 
- Track my growth with real code, not just theoretical studying. 

## 📂 Structure

Each problem includes:
- ✅ Working solution(s) in `Python`
- ⏱️ Time & space complexity notes (as much as possible)
