# 🧠 Blind 75 LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains solutions I've studided (not all are particularly mine) for the [Blind 75](neetcode.io) — a curated set of coding problems considered essential for software engineering interviews.

## 🚀 Purpose

I’m solving these problems to:
- Sharpen my algorithmic thinking
- Build a clean reference for common patterns
- Track my growth with real code, not just theoretical studying

## 📂 Structure

Each problem includes:
- ✅ Working solution(s) in `Python`
- ⏱️ Time & space complexity notes
